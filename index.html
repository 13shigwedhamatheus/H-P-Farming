            <h3>H and P Farming Enterprise Market Analysis</h3>

            <p>The analysis detail the economic climate, the mushroom production industry,
                the customer profile, and the completion that the business will face as it progresses through its business operations.
                Currently, the economic market condition in Namibia is moderate. The meltdown of the subprime mortage market
                coupled with increasing fuel prices has led many people to believe that the Namibia is on the cusp of an economic recession.<br>

                Mushrooms are widely known for their great taste and amazing health benefits. Packed with a ton of essential
                vitamins and minerals, they make for an excellent addition to your diet, adding flavor to many different recipes.<br>

                Mushrooms are a low-calorie food that packs a nutritional punch. Loaded with many health-boosting vitamins,
                minerals, and antioxidants, they’ve long been recognized as an important part of any diet. For instance,
                mushrooms raised with exposure to ultraviolet light are a good source of Vitamin D,
                an important component in bone and immune health.<br>

                Moreover, researchers have found a number of other excellent reasons for incorporating mushrooms into your diet.

                <h1>The best part of growing mushroom</h1>
                <p>Besides the tasty results — is that there’s always more to learn.</p>
                <p>There's no need to be in the dark about growing mushrooms. These tasty chameleons of the food world are
                    extremely healthy: they're fat-free, low in calories, and filled with vitamins, antioxidants, and other nutrients.<br>

                    They can even help keep your brain healthy. The main keys to growing mushrooms at home are establishing
                    the right growing conditions and acquiring mushroom spawn, which is the material used to propagate mushrooms.</p>

                <h4>How Mushrooms Grow?</h4>

                <p>Mushrooms grow from spores (not seeds) that are so tiny you can't see individual spores with the naked eye.
                    Rather than soil, these spores rely on substances like sawdust, grain, straw, or wood chips for nourishment.
                    A blend of the spores and these nutrient sources is called spawn. Mushroom spawn acts a bit like the starter
                    you need to make sourdough bread.

            <h1>PRODUCTION</h1>
            <h3>The biological rhythms of the,commercial mushroom.</h3>
            <h4>Mushrooms are a good source of numerous nutrients.</h4>
            <p>Mushroom farming consists of six steps, and although the divisions are somewhat arbitrary, these steps identify
                what is needed to form a production system. The six steps are <span>Phase I composting, Phase II composting, spawning,
                casing, pinning, and cropping.</span> These steps are described in their naturally occurring sequence, emphasizing the
                salient features within each step. Compost provides nutrients needed for mushrooms to grow.<br>

                Two types of material are generally used for mushroom compost, the most used and least expensive being
                wheat straw-bedded horse manure. Synthetic compost is usually made from hay and wheat straw,
                although the term often refers to any mushroom compost where the prime ingredient is not horse manure.<br><BR>

                Both types of compost require the addition of nitrogen supplements and a conditioning agent, gypsum.<br>

                <span>The preparation of compost</span> occurs in two steps referred to as Phase I and Phase II composting.
                The discussion of compost preparation and mushroom production begins with Phase I composting.<br>

                It takes approximately 14 weeks to complete an entire production cycle, from the start of composting to the final
                steaming off after harvesting has ended. Final yield depends on how well a grower has monitored and controlled
                the temperature, humidity, pests, and so on.<br>

                 All things considered, the most important factors for good production appear to be experience plus an intuitive
                feel for the biological rhythms of the commercial mushroom. The production system used to grow a crop can be
                chosen after the basics of mushroom growing are understood</p>
